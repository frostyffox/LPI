Data Science class assignment:
perform exploratory analysis and visualisation of the data.
Database to work on: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/owid-covid-data.csv

Summary: Instead of using a classic EDA approach , I was interested in understanding the missingness of the data, the relationship between deaths , cases and some socio-economic factors and finally the situation regarding hospitalisations.

PLOTS:

    1-D heat map of missing values per column
    Box plots of cases per million, by continent
    Facet grid of cases per million by continent (not very efficient)
    Bar plot for average CFR by continent
    Regplot for correlation between car and HDI, by continent
    Heat map for correlation between deaths, cases and indicators
    Box plot: hospitalisation burden by continent
    Global hospitalisation trend over time

In terms of analysis I would have loved to

    make a comparison between “developed” and “developing” countries
    Better question the correlation between some factors (age, smoking, life expectancy, etc
